            <div>About Bella Onojie Foods</div>
            <div>A client reached out to design and also develop a food app for her business (Bella Foods) delivery app. The MVP, designed and developed in three months, includes a shipment real-time tracking.The product was  first directly launched on the market on google playstore , in order to test the traction and validate the idea before it was released in app store.</div>

        <div class="h2">
            <div>Target and challenge</div>
            <div>Bella foods has a very clear target, a target that needs an extremely easy and fast to use solution. The app looks professional while also looking beautiful which distances itself from the normal food delivery app usage. Reliability was another key point: the real-time shipment tracking solves the usual shipment-related anxiety and builds trust from the first checkout.</div>
