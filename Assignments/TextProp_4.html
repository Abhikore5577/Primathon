    <h1>The thirsty crow</h1>
    <p class="first">
      One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water.
      For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all
      hope. Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down
      to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside
      the jug!The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw
      some pebbles. He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the
      pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles
      filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for
      the crow to drink. His plan had worked!
    </p>
    <p class="second">
      The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the
      neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for
      the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.
